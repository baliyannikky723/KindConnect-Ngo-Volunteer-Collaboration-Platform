                    <p class="post-description">If we need to address healthcare, poverty, population control, unemployment and human rights, there's no better way to start than providing education to children in need. Education not only empowers children to have a secure future but also helps them grow up as responsible national and global citizens. The Right to Education (RTE) Act which came into force in 2010 made education free and compulsory for all children in the age group of 6-14 years. But even a decade later, the learning curve has not been steady for many children in the country. We're excited to announce the opening of our new school in rural India, providing education to 500 children. Your support made this possible!</p>
